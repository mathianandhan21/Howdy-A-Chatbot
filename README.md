# Howdy-A-Chatbot

## Overview
As a beginner to data science, when thinking about the individual projects to start with, the first thing that strikes my mind was a chatbot. Eventhough there were several types of chatbot to develop, in this project I developed a Rule Based chatbot with the data provided with the intents.

## Technical Aspect
This Project is divided into two parts:

Machine Learning:
Hereby I have used Bag-of-words approach for the vector representation of words.Then I have trained the dataset on the top of Keras API.

Website:
Building a website using a Flask and load the model that has been saved. Deployed the website in Heroku with all the necessary packages mentioned in the required files.
